## About

**SCP Facilitia doesn't have any SCPs.**

Instead, it focuses only on the general aspects of SCP facilities. ⚙️

Some of the features SCP Facilitia offers include:

- Construction blocks
- Decoration/furniture blocks
- Doors
- Security cameras (CCTV)

<ins>More specialized aspects like SCPs and guns should be achieved through other add-ons.</ins>

SCP Facilitia is designed to be highly compatible,
so you should be able to use other add-ons in the same world just fine. 🤝
